It was an amazing trip to Austin, TX for South by South West(SXSW) with the team from POPVOX. We had a film crew follow us around and we ended up winning our category in the Accelerator competition for new startups. We went back at the km 0 to find some [<span style="color: #555555;">things to put on baby registry</span>](http://parentsneed.com/baby-registry-checklist/). Everything went perfect.
