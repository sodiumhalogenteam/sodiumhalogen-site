Ever replied to an email and thought you hit send...only to find out later you never hit send? Yea, me too. I wanted to make it up to my new friend Kaitlin, so I wrong an apology song.

From time to time, I write songs for clients, prospective clients and friends. It's been a while since I have done that, but I can feel myself doing more in the near future. It's just another way for me to express creativity.
